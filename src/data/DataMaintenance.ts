        question: "How to maintain the Seabob?",
        answer: [
            "POST RIDE:",
            "– Check to see if any water has leaked into the charging port. If so, check the cause of the leak which may include: broken seal, cap was damaged or screwed with insufficient torque.",
            "– Rinse the inside thoroughly with clean fresh water, after every use. Directing the water hose to all the openings, on the bow, sides and below the Seabob.",
            "– Ensure a steady stream of fresh water is applied directly into the trigger. While doing so press and de-press the trigger numerous times to loosen any sand, grit, debris that may affect its performance.",
            "– Wash the body with warm soapy water and dry before storage.",
            "REGULAR MAINTENANCE:",
            "– Keep your Seabob battery level in healthy 50% range.",
            "– Clean your Seabob thoroughly with fresh soapy water to remove any built-up salt or sand.",
            "– Make sure that all contacts on the charging points are dry and clean.",
            "– Send your Seabob to your authorised service centre for regular maintenance and check.",

        question: "Why is preventive maintenance important?",
        answer: [
            "The Seabob is mostly used on the sea surface and if it is driven under water, it would be for a short period of time and in many cases not deeper than 2,5m.",
            "Because of that driving regime, the seals are exposed to very little pressure variation. As a consequence they do not expand and contract. They become stiff and give in.",
            "Cold temperatures during winter off-season months only makes the contraction worse and decreases the flexibility to the sealing material.",
            "As a preventive maintenance we suggest to exchange O-rings & locking rings, replace any worn components, apply lubrication, remove traces of salt & corrosion, execute a safety test and look for any potential leaks and issues.",
        ],
    },
    {
        question: "Can I perform maintenance myself?",
        answer: [
            "Seabob can only be serviced by qualified Seabob technician who can properly assess Seabob condition and take all safety precautions.",
